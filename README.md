Gmail Data Analysis
Project Overview
The Gmail Data Analysis project focuses on analyzing Gmail data to extract insights such as email frequency, sender distribution, keyword trends, and user behavior patterns. The goal is to uncover actionable insights through data-driven analysis.

Features
Analyze Gmail metadata (e.g., senders, timestamps, subject lines).
Generate visualizations of email trends (daily, monthly, yearly).
Extract and visualize the most common keywords and topics.
Identify the distribution of emails by sender and category.
Explore response times and patterns.
Tools and Technologies
